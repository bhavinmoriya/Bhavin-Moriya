# My Portfolio

I am Bhavin. I teach Mathematics at The University of Vicosa. I am pretty excited about learning Data Science. I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires and a lot more. I shall be sharing some of my projects here.

# Project 0 : Basics
1. [Introduction to PySpark](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/introduction-to-pyspark)

## Project 2 : Recurrent Neural Networks and Time Series

1. [Fake News classifier using LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/fake-news-classifier-using-lstm)
2. [Conv1d, GRU, LSTM to forecast Time Series](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/neural-nets-for-prediction-of-the-google-stock)
3. [FBProphet to predict Air Passengers](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/playing-with-fb-prophet-great-prediction)
4. [FBProphet to forecase WIKIPedia pageviews and MSFT Stocks](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/facebook-prophet-wikipedia-msft-forecast)
5. [AirPassenger forecast using AutoARIMA](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/airpassenger-autoarima-almost-accurate-preds)
6. [Tuning FBProphet to predict TESLA stock](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/prophet-for-tesla-stock-prediction?scriptVersionId=82301626)
7. [Introduction to AutoARIMA](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/google-stocks-auto-arima#Stationarity)
   - ACF, PACF plots 
   - Trend order
   - Seasonal order

## Project 3 : Natural Language Processing

1. [IMDb Review - Sentiment Analysis with about 86% accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/imdb-review-sentiment-analysis-using-conv1d)
2. [Email Spam Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/email-spam-detection#Back-to-out-problem)

## Project 4 : Classification and Regression

1. [Regression using Neural Nets and RF, LR etc.](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/regression-using-neural-nets-and-rf-lr-etc)
2. [KNN with CuML(RAPIDS)](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/knn-with-cuml-gpu-could-be-heaven?scriptVersionId=82137414)
3. [Fashion MNIST classification with CNN](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/fashion-mnist-with-keras-88-accuracy)
4. [MNIST Digit classification using PCA and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/mnist-with-pca-and-gbdt)
   - The Digit image has 784 features. Using PCA we reduce the dimension to about 154, which is really drastic. However, we get about 93% accuracy.
5. [MNIST Digit Classification using Random Forest, KNN, SGD](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/mnist-digit-classification-using-sgd-knn-rf?scriptVersionId=82139615)
