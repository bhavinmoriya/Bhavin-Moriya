# My Portfolio

I am Bhavin. I am pretty excited learning DataScience. I shall be sharing some nice projects here.

# Project 1 : Introduction to KERAS
1. [Basics of Keras](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/playing-with-keras)
2. [Dogs and Cats classification](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/dogs-and-cats-classification-by-cnn-and-vgg16)
3. Transfer learning
   - [MobileNet - Predict images outside of training so well](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/mobilenet-small-but-real-good-too)
   - [MobileNet - A small model could do wonders](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/mobilenet-finetune-to-custom-datasets-99-acc)
   - [VGG 16 to improve DogsVsCats classification](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavinmoriya/dogs-and-cats-classification-by-cnn-and-vgg16)

## Project 2 : Recurrent Neural Networks
